						 <strong>What is an investment portfolio â€” a complete overview of the concept and types of portfolios</strong><p><span> </span><span><i>How does the portfolio generate and maintain liquidity? What is the principle of conservativeness of the investment portfolio? What are the features of portfolio diversification optimization?</i></span></p><p><span>A risk-free investment not happen. This rule should be learned by every novice investor. There are no assets with a 100% guarantee of profit, otherwise every investor would become Henry Ford and Warren Buffett. Even a Bank Deposit is not such a reliable tool as financial institutions position it to be. </span></p><h3><span><b>We recommend brokers for Forex trading:</b></span></h3><ul><li><span></span><a><b>ALPARI</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>ROBOFOREX</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>Forex4You</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>AMarkets</b></a></li><li><span></span><a><b>InstaForex</b></a></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The level of profitability is affected by thousands of reasons â€“ economic crises, inflation, financial illiteracy, currency exchange rate fluctuations, stock market disasters. However, the investor has an effective way to minimize the risks if not eliminate them completely. This method is called "investment portfolio".</span></p><p><span>When creating a portfolio, you do not invest in one instrument, but rather use several investment strategies.  Denis Kuderin, an investment specialist, will explain how this is done and what types of investment portfolios there are in a new article.</span></p><p><span>And you will also find an overview of reliable professional companies that will help you create a portfolio and manage it competently.</span></p><p><span>Forward, friends!</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span></span></p><h2><span>1. What is investment portfolio</span></h2><p><span>Why do experienced investors earn more than newcomers? Do you think because the latter have less money? The answer is obvious, but not quite correct. Of course, the amount of investment directly affects the profitability, but the determining role is played by completely different factors.</span></p><p><span>Experienced financiers know how to properly apply investment tools and know how to manage them as effectively as possible. They are aware that the more investment options involved, the lower the risk of bankruptcy and the higher the probability of obtaining a loan stable and long-term income.</span></p><blockquote><span><i>A beginner is looking for the most profitable and promising asset, just as knights were looking for the Holy Grail. And when he finds it, he rushes to invest all his cash in it. This method may work, or it may ruin the investor. If you are a player by nature and want to play, but not earn money â€“ then this path is for you.</i></span></blockquote><p><span>Smart investors do things differently. They are not looking for the highest</span><span><i>-</i></span><span>yielding instruments. They combine conservative investments with moderate risk and high-risk investments. If one option does not work, ten other tools will overlap potential loss.</span></p><blockquote><span><i>The investor's total assets constitute his / her </i></span><span></span><span><i><b>investment portfolio </b></i></span><span><i>. This portfolio contains securities or other types of investments that allow the owner to make a profit at the expense of interest, dividends or speculative investments operations'.</i></span></blockquote><p><span>Unlike </span><span><u>real investments </u></span><span>, portfolio investments do not involve the active participation of the investor in the management of projects and companies in which he invests money.</span></p><p><span>How do I choose assets for my investment portfolio? The principle of this choice is simple: focus on stable returns with minimal risks.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><blockquote><span>In order not to be unfounded, I will give you an example of the correct investment portfolio:<br></span><span><i>Some of the money (about 30%) is placed on deposits in reliable banks. It is advisable to select several institutions â€“ for example, Sberbank, Alfa-Bank, and Tinkoff.</i></span><span><br></span><span><i>Half of the assets invested in government and corporate bonds and shares of large, steadily growing Russian and foreign corporations â€“ Gazprom, Google, Yandex, Surgutneftegaz, LUKOIL, etc.</i></span><span><br></span><span><i>The remaining funds are placed in the high-risk instruments â€“ shares of "undervalued" companies, startups, options.</i></span></blockquote><p><span>The main advantage </span><span><u>of portfolio investments is </u></span><span>their high liquidity. The investor has the right to transfer securities and other assets to live money at any time and withdraw from the market. With direct investment. the procedure is not easy to perform, and sometimes it is not possible until the end of the project implementation period.</span></p><p><span>A professional always keeps some of his money in instruments that are resistant to internal and global market fluctuations. For example, government bonds with a fixed value cannot fall in price and make a profit regardless of the state of the market. The presence of such assets in the portfolio is a guarantee of its liquidity.</span></p><p><span>However, as I have already said, it is impossible to completely exclude investment risks.</span></p><p><span><b>It is worth listing the most common risks:</b></span></p><ul><li><span>wrong choice of instruments (most of the assets invested in the shares of unstable companies with questionable prospects);</span></li><li><span>inflation â€” be sure to take this indicator into account when planning future earnings;</span></li><li><span>bad timing for investing-experienced savers buy stocks when they sell everything, not the other way around.</span></li></ul><p><span>Each investor has its own approach an approach to forming an investment portfolio. The most successful investor of our time, Warren Buffett, invested money in companies that, from the point of view of other market participants, were unpromising.</span></p><p><span>Not only securities are included in the portfolio of a visionary investor. The choice of destinations is almost limitless â€“ gold and other precious metals, real estate, insurance savings funds, </span><span><u>PAMM accounts </u></span><span>and much more.</span></p><h2><span>2. What are the types of investment portfolios â€“ TOP 7 main types</span></h2><p><span>The classification of investment portfolios is quite conditional. Professional investors try to combine different investment strategies investment strategy. It happens that one half of their portfolio is profitable, the other half is made up of growth investments.</span></p><p><span>However, it is necessary for every investor to know what types of portfolios there are.</span></p><h3><span><u>View 1.</u></span><span> Income portfolio</span></h3><p><span>From the name, it is clear that such a portfolio is designed for high income from investment with minimal risk and is preferred for conservative investors.</span></p><p><span>It includes bonds (government and corporate) with small regular payments, shares of large companies in the raw materials or energy industries. Income from such a portfolio is generated mainly by interest and dividends'. If we talk about indicators, this is 10-25% per annum.</span></p><h3><span><u>View 2.</u></span><span> The growth of the portfolio</span></h3><p><span>The growth portfolio's profit is provided by an increase in the value of securities. This tool is used by investors who want to make a significant profit. Investment directions-shares of the company developing companies, startups.</span></p><p><span>The risks of the growth portfolio are quite high, but if the depositor sells his assets on time, the profits will also be significant. The rates of return are not limited.</span></p><h3><span><u>View 3.</u></span><span> Balanced portfolio</span></h3><p><span>A moderate investor's portfolio. Formed from valuable data it has a stable composition of securities of well-known companies. The owner of such a portfolio is focused on long-term and capital conservation. However, a small part of the assets may be stocks with rapidly changing values, but this risk is always justified and is under strict control.</span></p><h3><span><u>View 4.</u></span><span> Portfolio risk capital</span></h3><p><span>A portfolio of an exchange-traded player aimed at maximum capital gains. Such an investor knows that the highest returns are generated by the highest-risk investments. The assets include shares of new and fast-growing enterprises, as well as companies developing new technologies.</span></p><h3><span><u>View 5.</u></span><span> Portfolio of long-term securities</span></h3><p><span>A conservative portfolio designed for long periods of time. The owner acts on the principle of "bought and forgot". To engage in such an investment, you need to have a solid budget, because the invested money will not be available for several months years.</span></p><p><span></span></p><blockquote><span>Typical example<br></span><span><i>The five-year Federal loan bonds issued in 2012 by the Central Bank were repaid in spring 2017. All owners of such securities will return their money in full. They have already received income from coupons that were paid out every six months for the entire term actions of the bonds.</i></span></blockquote><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Let's go back to Warren Buffett, who is clearly a long â€“ term investor. He said: Â«</span><span><i>If you don't plan to hold a stock for 10 years, then don't buy it even for 10 minutes. Stable returns are a big deal a long time</i></span><span>".</span></p><p><span></span></p><h3><span><u>View 6.</u></span><span> Short-term securities portfolio</span></h3><p><span>The opposite of a long-term portfolio. This package includes investments of maximum liquidity and quick return of funds. Example-investments in exchange and currency speculation on the Forex market, </span><span><u>investments in MFI </u></span><span>.</span></p><h3><span><u>View 7.</u></span><span> Portfolios with regional or foreign securities</span></h3><p><span>Portfolios for patriots of their own region or entrepreneurs who thoroughly know the internal market of their own region. Types of specialized portfolios â€“ sets of industry-specific securities (for example, oil refining companies), shares of foreign companies.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2><span>3. The procedure for forming an investment portfolio â€“ 5 main stages</span></h2><p><span>So, you have firmly decided to form your investment portfolio. Let's look at what it will take to do this.</span></p><p><span>I recommend all newbies to follow the principle of conservatism. This means that the portfolio should be based on conservative and reliable financial instruments. You will take risks later, when you increase your assets by 50-100%. In the meantime, be reasonable, patient, and consistent.</span></p><p><span>And clearly follow the expert guidance.</span></p><h3><span><u>Stage 1.</u></span><span> Setting investment goals</span></h3><p><span>The more specific the goals of an investor, the more effective their financial activities will be. If a person comes to the market with vague intentions, the result will also be vague and uncertain. The goal of "making a little extra money if you can" is not going to work. Set real and realistic goals for yourself. specific task.</span></p><p><span>Pros work for the result. He comes to the exchange prepared and ready to win. At the same time, he never forgets about security for a minute. Its capital is invulnerable to external shocks, and it is protected from impulsive decisions by a well-chosen strategy.</span></p><blockquote><span><i>Decide in advance how many and why do you want to make money on your investments? The correct goals are to increase your capital by 50% over a year, save for a car, and earn more on the stock exchange than on your main job.</i></span></blockquote><p><span>I would advise novice investors to work with a professional adviser. Many brokerage companies even perform such functions free. Do not neglect qualified help, listen to wise advice and follow it.</span></p><h3><span><u>Stage 2.</u></span><span> Choosing an investment strategy</span></h3><p><span>The choice of strategy depends on the personal preferences of the investor and his final goals.</span></p><p><span><b>In fact, there are only 3 strategies investments:</b></span></p><ul><li><span>aggressive;</span></li><li><span>conservative;</span></li><li><span>moderate.</span></li></ul><p><span>An aggressive (or active) strategy involves constant monitoring of market changes. An active investor is constantly active â€“ buying, selling, reinvesting. Its goal is to increase the capital in the shortest possible time deadlines. This strategy requires time, knowledge, and resources.</span></p><p><span>A passive strategy is to wait and see. The depositor does not participate in intermediate processes and only counts on long-term results. Or it makes a profit from dividends, interest, and coupons. This is the strategy I would recommend for beginners. A little boring, but reliable.</span></p><h3><span><u>Stage 3. </u></span><span>Analysis of the securities market</span></h3><p><span>Based on your investment goals, analyze the securities market and determine the most appropriate tools for your strategy. At this stage, I recommend choosing a reliable broker-guide in the infinite financial world maze.</span></p><p><span>Investing on the stock exchange is certainly more difficult than making Bank deposits, but it is much easier than earning money by working daily in a factory or in an office. The main thing is to take responsibility for financial decisions and understand the exchange mechanisms at least at the level of an Amateur.</span></p><p><span>But not it is worth rushing into the pool with your head. First, read blogs, articles, and books for beginners. Once you understand how bonds differ from stocks and what ETFs are, gradually move to practice. Study the quotes of companies for the current and last year, see how much these or other securities have grown, and what kind of income it is brought them to their owners.</span></p><blockquote><span><i>Another option is to open a demo account with a training broker, which every professional company has, and trade virtual shares for some time. This will help you get used to the market and understand the basic principles of trading.</i></span></blockquote><p><span>Some beginners choose a strategy follow experienced investors. Sometimes brokers allow you to study the portfolios of successful players and invest money on the principle of"do as I do".</span></p><h3><span><u>Stage 4.</u></span><span> Selecting assets for the portfolio</span></h3><p><span>Exchange-traded investments are unpredictable, but this is not a lottery or a casino game. Here you have the right to control the situation yourself and balance the risks. It is impossible to predict the exact profit, especially for shares of the domestic Russian market, but the approximate growth of revenues under a conservative strategy is quite certain.</span></p><p><span>Distribute assets in those areas that you are at least minimally familiar with. It's not worth it, for example, invest in futures if you don't know how they work. It is better to put the remaining undistributed funds in the currency. Let there be free money in the broker's account.</span></p><h3><span><u>Stage 5.</u></span><span> The purchase of securities and the monitoring of the formed portfolio</span></h3><p><span>Securities are purchased on the exchange via the following channels: broker's. Direct money is rarely invested in stocks. This is done mainly by experienced investors with a lot of money.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Buying assets and forgetting about them is the wrong tactic. Even if you are the most conservative investor in the world, it is necessary to regularly review the portfolio and conduct an audit at least once a quarter or half a year. Some papers will have to be disposed of, and some, on the contrary, will have to be purchased.</span></p><p><span></span></p><h2><span>4. Professional assistance in portfolio investing â€“ review of the TOP 3 brokerage companies</span></h2><p><span>I have already said that without a broker in the securities market, a novice can do nothing. A broker is not only an intermediary who receives a percentage for his services, it is your eyes and ears. The more reliable the conductor, the higher the profit margin.</span></p><p><span>On some exchanges, brokers combine the duties of a financial adviser. Sometimes even for no extra charge.</span></p><p><span>Take a look at the most reliable brokerage houses in Russia companies and use their services.</span></p><h3><span>1) FINAM</span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>The oldest broker in Russia (the company was founded in 1994). In addition to brokerage services, he is engaged in capital management, training, foreign exchange operations, direct investments in manufacturing and the economy. Heading for constant development and implementation of the latest information technologies and client services in practice.</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>FINAM specialists will help the client to form an investment portfolio, choose the most profitable and promising areas themselves in accordance with their goals and financial capabilities investor's.</span></p><p><span>Open a demo account or a real brokerage account directly on the company's website. The procedure takes a few minutes. Almost immediately, you get access to exchange operations with securities and currency. The company promises an income of 18% per year even with a passive investment strategy.</span></p><h3><span>2) GoldMan Capital</span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>The firm provides consulting services in the field of private and corporate investments. These guys will not only tell you what an effective investment portfolio is, but also help you create one.</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Each client is assigned an individual profile a portfolio Manager who manages assets in order to extract maximum profit from them. The intermediary's income depends on your income, so the consultants have a vested interest in the client's well-being.</span></p><h3><span>3) FMC</span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Another intermediary firm with a long-term our experience and impeccable reputation. Clients get access to investments in shares of the largest global and Russian corporations. Do you want to become a co-owner of Microsoft, Gazprom, Coca-Cola or Apple? There is nothing easier â€“ register with FMC and get a personal consultant who will guide your investment process the portfolio for the entire investment period.</span></figcaption></figure><h2><span>5. What are the ways of optimizing the investment portfolio â€“ 3 basic ways</span></h2><p><span>A lazy person will always find a reason why they will not invest. He would rather believe Sergey Mavrodi than believe himself, or would he buy up household appliances when the dollar starts to get more expensive.</span></p><p><span>An active and far-sighted individual who thinks about the future does not engage in such nonsense. He is looking for ways to optimize his personal investment portfolio. With it, he is not afraid of internal crises, currency jumps and falls of the ruble.</span></p><p><span>Optimization methods there are many portfolios, but I will consider the most effective ones.</span></p><h3><span><u>Method 1.</u></span><span> Portfolio diversification</span></h3><p><span>The first and main rule of an investor. In plain English, it means "Many eggs, many baskets." The more tools you choose, the lower the risks. But we also need to calculate our income in such a way that we can cover all of the above expenses. inflation.</span></p><p><span><b>Classic diversification looks like this:</b></span></p><ul><li><span>50-70% invests in low-risk investments;</span></li><li><span>up to 20% is placed in high-yield areas with a high degree of risk;</span></li><li><span>the rest goes to reserve needs and is placed on Bank deposits or, for example, unallocated bullion account.</span></li></ul><p><span>It is not necessary to adhere to this exact ratio. The main thing is not to break the balance by investing too much in one asset.</span></p><h3><span><u>Method 2. </u></span><span>Bank deposits</span></h3><p><span>Another way for people who primarily value reliability in investment. Distribute the money to the largest banks in the country. But make sure that your deposits do not exceed the amount of state insurance. At the time of writing, it is equal to 1.4 million rubles.</span></p><p><span>Banks, by the way, also offer individual investment programs. For example, Sberbank has a secure program for individuals with a guaranteed refund of the initial payment. At the same time, the depositor chooses 1 out of 5 possible investment directions.</span></p><h3><span><u>Method 3.</u></span><span> Real estate investments</span></h3><p><span>If you live in a large locality, then </span><span><u>investing in residential and commercial real estate </u></span><span>will help not only to save, but also to increase the initial capital. At least, you will definitely cover inflation, and if you invest in an object at the construction stage, you will definitely get a future income of 30-70%.</span></p><p><span>Expand your horizons â€“ watch an interesting video on the topic of publication.</span></p><h2><span>6. Conclusion</span></h2><p><span>Now you know that this is an investment portfolio and how it differs from the student portfolio. Remember the main thing â€“ financial literacy is achieved only in a practical way. Don't be afraid to invest in yourself. The road will be mastered by the walking one!</span></p><div></div>
