						 <strong>Larry Williams trading strategy (manual)</strong><p><span> </span></p><p><span>A detailed description of one of Larry Williams ' main strategies. Instructions and examples, the essence and psychology of the trading strategy.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span></span></p><p><span><b>Larry R. Williams </b></span><span>( </span><span><i>Larry </i></span><span>Williams is a famous stock trader, born in 1942 in the state of Montana in the United States. Williams is well known for the large number of indicators he has created, including </span><span><i>the Ultimate Oscillator, the Williams% R indicator, market sentiment, COT indexes, cycle forecasts, </i></span><span>and others.</span></p><p><span>Williams started his trading career career in Forex in 1965. He quickly established himself as a trader with innovative views on the foreign exchange market. Soon after, he developed his most successful trading tool, the Williams% R dynamics indicator. In 1987, Larry R. Williams won the world futures trading championship, managing to earn </span><span><b>1,100,000 dollars </b></span><span>with a starting capital of only 10,000. This incredible success was achieved in 12 months and was based mainly on innovative methods of futures trading. Later, he published a book about this experience, entitled "how to make money online".</span><span><i>How I made a million dollars in the past year</i></span><span>".</span></p><h2><span><b>The Larry Williams Strategy</b></span></h2><p><span>In simple terms, the short-term strategy of Larry Williams is to buy and sell assets at the price of a three-bar moving average minimum. To determine the trading points to open and close a position at Williams developed his own theory of local highs and lows based on three-bar patterns.</span></p><ul><li><span>The local high is the candle with the highest high compared to the previous and next one;</span></li><li><span>The local minimum is, respectively, a candle with a minimum less than two neighboring.</span></li></ul><p><span>By tracking the peak positions of candlesticks of several patterns, you can form a medium-term local minimum and maximum, and by grouping several medium-term ones, you can get long-term data.</span></p><h3><span><b>The Psychology Of Larry Williams</b></span></h3><p><span>This strategy works in two ways scenarios:</span></p><ul><li><span>When the daily bar opens below the previous day's low.</span></li><li><span>Or when the daily bar opens above the previous trading day.</span></li></ul><p><span>At first glance, the theory of this pattern is very simple and logical. However, Larry himself believes that newcomers who have a bad sense of the market and are not yet ready to if you have learned to follow trends, it will be difficult to profit from it.</span></p><p><span>In his interviews, he repeatedly pointed out the main mistake of non â€” professionals-they check General charts at night and immediately enter their orders for the upcoming day. A smart trader, according to Williams, is always better off waiting for the trend to take shape actually and, accordingly, place your orders during the day.</span></p><p><span>Describing this approach in more detail, we can note the following pattern: if the market opens significantly lower or higher than yesterday's range, it indicates a panic of non-professional traders. This is a great opportunity professionals use the emotions of alarmists against themselves.</span></p><p><span>Non-professional traders, according to Williams, usually overreact to some important news even before the start of trading and create a strong gap when the market opens. This indicator, he calls " </span><span><i>the result of the opinion of the average the </i></span><span>crowds."</span></p><p><span>Soon, these traders notice that they are overreacting to the initial event or news and, realizing their mistake, drastically overestimate their position. This leads to a change in prices and movement in the opposite direction. These fluctuations on provides a lot of valuable information for those who he trades professionally on the FOREX market. And it works best on daily and weekly charts.</span></p><h3><span><b>Buy and sell using the Larry Williams trading strategy</b></span></h3><p><span>The Williams buying strategy is explained in the following paragraphs:</span></p><ul><li><span>There should be an existing downtrend, at least on several trading sessions. This is usually indicated by red candles on the daily or weekly chart.</span></li><li><span>At the last stage of the downtrend, the market should lag behind yesterday's low. This becomes a signal to buy.</span></li><li><span>As the market situation is re-evaluated by investors, the price of real estate increases. it starts to grow and crosses yesterday's low. This gives a signal to buy.</span></li><li><span>Stop loss is the minimum of the same day.</span></li></ul><p><span>The sale is calculated according to the following scheme:</span></p><ul><li><span>You need to closely monitor the chart and find long-term upward trends, at least for several trading pairs sessions'.</span></li><li><span>At the last stage of the upward trend needs to come to a rupture, which becomes a signal to sell. Even better, if the price opens much higher than yesterday's high.</span></li><li><span>As the revaluation by investors progresses, the price starts to fall and eventually overcomes yesterday's the high and yesterday's close. After this has happened, you should open a short trade.</span></li><li><span>Stop loss is the maximum of the same day.</span></li></ul><blockquote><span><b>The main thing that Larry has learned is how important it is to learn to wait for your "Golden" moment.</b></span></blockquote><p><span>Alarmists rush and lose, those who are too cautious pull to the last and miss their opportunities. And the one who can wait for a stable trend to form and start acting at the right moment will receive a reward.</span></p><h3><span><b>"The peak point of the oscillationÂ»</b></span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>As you can see in the picture, this pattern consists of three bars, the Central one indicating the minimum or maximum value. For example, you should buy when the Central bar is at the peak of its minimum. In General, the starting point in building the pattern here will be the bar that is at its peak position, relative to neighboring.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>When a buy signal appears, Williams advises placing a stop order, retreating by a couple of points from the local minimum, and for selling, respectively, by the same number of points from the local maximum.</span></p><p><span>To use this technique on in practice, Larry Williams advises you to pay attention to the emerging trend, and not to the main trend that can be traced at the moment. This allows you to reject false signals and increase your chances of success.</span></p><h3><span><b>"Internal and External DayÂ»</b></span></h3><p><span>Another combination used by Williams in the his strategy.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>In this case, the "Inner Day" is two bars, of which the first will be the starting point, and the second will be placed inside. Simply put, the maximum and minimum values of the second bar will always be less than the first (</span><span><i>which is clearly visible in the chart below). the </i></span><span>image ). How does this chart determine the direction of opening a trade? The second bar here will indicate the desired direction. The opening price above the closing price can be perceived as a sell signal and Vice versa.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><h3><span><b>"External DayÂ»</b></span></h3><p><span>Â«External Day", as you can guess, is the exact opposite of "Inner Day". Its base is also two bars, but as you can see in the diagram, the first one is already placed inside the second one.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Here, the price fluctuations between the peaks of the minimum and maximum of the second will always be greater than that of the second first.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>This means that the essence of the "External day" is opposition to the trend. For example, if the market is growing and a drop-down pattern gives a signal to start trading, you need to enter a sell position. And Vice versa, with a General downtrend, after the signal to start trading, you need to buy.Â  In General, the stop is set at the minimum or maximum peak of the second bar (depends on the side of entry).</span></p><h3><span><b>"Impact DayÂ»</b></span></h3><p><span>Observing the market, Larry Williams discovered that there are days when prices make a strong upward or downward pull that encourages the masses to buy the opening of co-directional positions that further spur the movement. However, as a rule, the next day comes the payback, the price unfolding forces you to close at a loss previously placed orders. Larry Williams gave such events a name - the turn of the strike day.</span></p><p><span>Based on this, the trader highlighted two type of strike days (Fig. 1):</span></p><ul><li><span>impact day of purchase;</span></li><li><span>impact day of the sale.</span></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Fig. 1</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>A strike day for buying (Fig. 2) is a day when the price closes below the minimum of the previous trading session, and such days can also be closed below the lows of 3-8 previous trading days. On the price chart, this resembles a bearish breakout after a huge sell-off.</span></p><p><span>In this case, short-term traders are rarely right, since the market generally turns around immediately and completely. A good option in fact would not be to sell but purchase in this case.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Fig. 2</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The impact day for selling is complete (Fig. 3), the opposite of the purchase day. This is the day when prices close above the highs of the previous trading session, and possibly several previous sessions. The price movement has the form after a bullish breakout, there is a process of numerous purchases.</span></p><p><span>The bulls ' players are also likely to be wrong in this case and suffer losses. The artificially accelerated price movement will return to its equilibrium state after a shock day. Therefore, it is more appropriate in this case to open a position on the sale.</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Fig. 3</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Let's sum up a short summary of the material considered, in order to avoid confusion in the concepts.</span></p><p><span>So, the impact day is called the day of active price movement, the price as it were strikes producing a break up or down. Larry Williams starts trading not on the strike day, but after it with an order opposite to the direction of the "price strike". The strike day pattern is the pattern of displaying the strike day on the price chart.</span></p><p><span>It should be noted that the book "</span><span><u><b>Long-term secrets of short-term trading</b></u></span><span>" contains another view the shock of the day â€“ hidden shock day. In simple words, it can be noted that this is an analog of a shock day, but the price breakout in this case does not go beyond the minimum or maximum points of the past session, but is located in a 25% range from these points (in the 25% range of the entire daily movement Fig. 4).</span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Fig. 4</span></figcaption></figure><h3><span><b>The use of figures of percussion day</b></span></h3><p><span>Larry Williams identifies three ways to use the strike day figure:</span></p><ul><li><span>In an uptrend, they are guided by the strike day pattern for buying. In this case, the trend will become another one confirmation of a price reversal upward, after a blow that took the price past the minimum of the previous trading session or at least into the 25% daily price movement zone adjacent to the minimum of the previous trading session.</span></li><li><span>In a downtrend, the target figure is the strike day for selling. The trend will help you open a short position positions, after all, after a price strike for the highs of the previous trading session, or when the price hits the 25% zone with a hidden strike day, the price movement should turn around.</span></li><li><span>When the market is flat, i.e. price consolidation at any particular level, the trader can equally focus on the appearance of both figures of the strike day - both for buying and selling (Fig. 5).</span></li></ul><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Fig. 5</span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Larry Williams '"Strike day" trading strategy is a rather unusual approach to analyzing price movements. At the same time, this strategy allows for a high degree of probability find points of entry into the market. At the same time, this method of trading can be fully compatible with trend trading, which makes its effectiveness more predictable.</span></p><p><span>The strategy can also be used to find successful entry points to the market, both by traders trading using technical analysis, and by those who, who uses fundamental data. In addition to its proven effectiveness, the strategy has a great versatility, which makes it possible to integrate it into various trading systems.</span></p><p><span>Larry Williams ' system is based on simple signals originating from various combinations of bars. Clear and simple rules to enter the auction and install "stops" helped its Creator to earn a multimillion-dollar fortune.</span></p><p><span>But for most novice traders who are passionate about the success of Williams and other super-successful investors, and do not want to spend years of their lives learning the fundamentals of trading, this approach is doomed to fail failure.</span></p><p><span>Therefore, Larry himself always focuses on two things in his instructions for impatient newcomers: following the trend and managing money.</span></p><h3><span><b>Money management tips from Larry Williams</b></span></h3><p><span>The main rules for successful money management, according to the author, are as follows following:</span></p><ul><li><span>Â«</span><span><i>Money management should start before you enter the trade. You need to know how many trades you can trade, and what amount you can risk on </i></span><span>each of them."</span></li><li><span>Â«</span><span><i>Never invest more than 30% of your capital if you are experienced, and 20% if you are a newbie </i></span><span>."</span></li><li><span>Â«</span><span><i>Don't trade more than six markets at a time</i></span><span>."</span></li><li><span>Â«</span><span><i>When you feel absolutely certain that you can't lose, this is the time of the greatest risk of losing everything</i></span><span>."</span></li><li><span>Â«</span><span><i>You must risk no more than 5% of your capital on one deal, regardless of your experience.</i></span><span>"</span></li></ul><p><span>Tips on money management have an important place in the strategy of Larry Williams. No wonder he does not get tired of repeating them in almost every new book.</span></p><h3><span><b>The best brokers for trading and investing</b></span></h3><p><span>The Larry Williams system is used it is used by numerous investors and traders, and even today it shows one of the highest rates of accuracy and reliability. This gives everyone a chance to earn money with its help.</span></p><p><span>However, the author himself advises not to forget the fact that the FOREX market is often chaotic. Therefore, its strategy is not pure "mechanical", and allows possible variations. And anyone who dares to use it will still have to work through trial and error to determine how it will work in different trading conditions and markets.</span></p><p><span>To sum up the above, it is best to say goodbye to Larry himself, presented in one of the following chapters: from his book:</span></p><blockquote><span><b>"Forex trading is an unstable game, so you should never be afraid of losses. Because of the volatility of the market, there is always another opportunity to catch up. So if you lose today, try to succeed tomorrow."</b></span></blockquote><div></div>
